Python Data Types

- integers: int whole numbers
- floating points: float, numbers with decimal points
- strings: str ordered sequences of strings
- booleans: bool logical value indicating true or false

Data Structure:  
- lists: list ordered sequences of objects [10, "hello"]
- dictionaries: unordered key value pairs {"mykey" : "values, "names", "Frankie"}
- Tuples: tup ordered immutable sequence of objects (1, "hello", 12)
- Sets: unordered collection of unique objects {"a", "b","c"}


Lists:
-Lists are ordered sequences that can hold a vareity of object types 
- They use [] brackets and commas to separate objects in the list
- Lists support indexing and slicing. 
-Lists can be nested and also have a variet of useful methods

Dictionaries:
- Unordered mappings for storing objects.
- This key-value pir allow users to quickly grab objects wiwthout needing to know an index location

Dictionaries vs Lists
Dictionaries are objects retrived by keyname

lists are objects retrived by location and order sequence can be indexed or sliced.

Tuples
- Are similar to lists, but are immutable.
- Once as element is inside a tuple it cannot be reassigned.

Sets
- unordered collections of unique elements
- they can only be one represenative of the same object
